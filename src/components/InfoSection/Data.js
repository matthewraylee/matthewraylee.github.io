    "I am born in Jakarta, Indonesia and have been studying computer \
    science at the University of Maryland, College Park. I want to be a \
    software developer because it allows me to express my creativity and \
    challenge myself with problem-solving skills to do meaningful work. \n\
    \n\
    In academics, I am also interested in several different topics but I chose \
    business innovation and entrepreneurship as my minor since I am particularly \
    interested in how companies started and achieve sustainability. Outside of \
    academics, I am also interested in exploring all different kinds of \
    activities which includes sports and music. When I am not studying, you can \
    find me in the golf driving range, playing a few rounds of badminton or \
    practicing the piano.",
