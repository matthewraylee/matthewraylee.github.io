        The team loves going on road trips but there are times some of us \
        don't know the lyrics to a song. This is what inspired us to create \
        Caraoke, where you can view lyrics to a song, synced to your Spotify \
        account, fitted in the air vents of your car. Utilizing Spotify's API, \
        we were able to get the current playing song and with the \
        help of Textyl.co's API to get the lyrics. Finally, we used an \
        Arduino Genuino 101 to send lyric informaion to our LCD screen. ",

        Library. This involves defining the network through weight and bias initialization as well as \
        performing back-propagation to allow network to continuously learn. Training with 2000 images, \
        the MLP model was able to achieve an accuracy of 88% while the CNN model was able to achieve 94%. ",
